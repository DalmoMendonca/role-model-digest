# Role Model Digest Roadmap
- [ ] When a user invites a peer with an email address that does not already have an account, it should generate a premium, state-of-the-art invitation email that gets sent to that peer, explaining simply what Role Model Digest is and that their peer (include full name and their role model) has invited them to join and keep tabs on a role model of their own.
- [ ] Commit this app to https://github.com/DalmoMendonca/role-model-digest. I will connect this repo with a Netlify project so that the app will be hosted on https://digest.hiredalmo.com.
- [ ] Ensure new digests are automatically created for all users with a role model every Monday morning.
