0. Something went wrong with the last code update, the home page is not loading. PLEASE HELP.

1. The notification bell is still on the navbar, which is on the left side on desktop. That looks GOOFY AS HELL. Please, change it! Maybe it needs to be a floating bell with a number badge on to bottom right of the screen. FIX IT.

2. The role model profile picture is still HUGE and not inside of the little avatar box on the top left. You need to find the root cause, address it, fixt it, and prove to me that your changes will get the picture to show up where it needs to.

3. The problem with the reactions is that when I HOVER over the "React" button, all the 8 icons appear. That makes me think I can just move my mouse to select one of those icons. But as soon as I move my cursor to click an icon, all the icons disappear. So this is BAD. Right now, I have to CLICK the "React" button in order for that tray to stick around. Use your UI/UX chops and design and implement a much better solution here.

4. I'm still seeing this when I click on a role model on the Social page: Role Model Not Found - Request failed.
